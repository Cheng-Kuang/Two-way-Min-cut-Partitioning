# Two-way-Min-cut-Partitioning
In this homework, we assume that two dies are implemented with different technologies, and you are asked to partition all cells into two groups each of which is put in a different die without violating the maximum area utilization constraint of
the die. The size of each die is the same. The size of a cell could vary according to the technology of the die it is in.
